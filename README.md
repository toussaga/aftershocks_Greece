# aftershocks_Greece

This repository contains the codes used in the study “The Role of Co-seismic Devolatilization in Driving Aftershock Sequences in Greece,” authored by Gaëlle Toussaint et al., submitted in _JGR: Solid Earth_. The code simulates the co-seismic generation of fluids from thermal decomposition and the diffusion of these fluids, to reproduce the aftershock patterns of 3 sequences in Greece: 1) the 2021 Thiva sequence (Beotia, Central Greece), 2) the 2021 Damasi-Tyrnavos sequence (Thessaly, Central Greece), and 3) the 2012-2014 Florina sequence (Northern Greece).

## Dependancies
This code is written in MATLAB. To use this code, you need:
+ [3D-Simulation-Visualization MATLAB package] (https://github.com/TerdikGyorgy/3D-Simulation-Visualization)
